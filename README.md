# Gemini Desktop

A powerful, modern desktop UI for Gemini CLI.  Built with Tauri and web technologies.  Cross-platform, open-source on [GitHub.](https://github.com/Piebald-AI/gemini-desktop)

> [!WARNING]
> We're working on implementing automatic saving on top of Gemini CLI, but it's ultimately a hack.  It would be more robust to have automatic recording incorporated into the Gemini CLI itself.  We've opened PR [#4401](https://github.com/google-gemini/gemini-cli/pull/4401) on the Gemini CLI repo with a complete implementation; please :+1: it to encourage it to be merged!

## How it works

Gemini CLI can function as an ACP (Agent Communication Protocol) server, which enables real-time communication via JSON RPC 2.0 between the client, Gemini Desktop, and the server, Gemini CLI.

## Building

```
git clone https://github.com/Piebald-AI/gemini-desktop
cd gemini-desktop
pnpm install
pnpm tauri dev
```

## Features

- Choose between models (Gemini 2.5 Pro, Gemini 2.5 Flash, Gemini 2.5 Flash-Lite)
- Send messages to/from Gemini and receive responses
