# Gemini Desktop

A powerful, modern desktop and web UI for Gemini CLI.  Built with Tauri and web technologies.  Cross-platform, open-source on [GitHub.](https://github.com/Piebald-AI/gemini-desktop)

> [!WARNING]
> We're working on implementing automatic saving on top of Gemini CLI, but it's ultimately a hack.  It would be more robust to have automatic recording incorporated into the Gemini CLI itself.  We've opened PR [#4401](https://github.com/google-gemini/gemini-cli/pull/4401) on the Gemini CLI repo with a complete implementation; please :+1: it to encourage it to be merged!

## Features

- Choose between models (Gemini 2.5 Pro, Gemini 2.5 Flash, Gemini 2.5 Flash-Lite)
- Send messages to/from Gemini and receive responses
- Handle tool call requests
- Markdown support ([#1](https://github.com/Piebald-AI/gemini-desktop/issues/1))

### Planned

- Automatic chat history saving ([#2](https://github.com/Piebald-AI/gemini-desktop/issues/2)).  Note: See related PRs [#4401](https://github.com/google-gemini/gemini-cli/pull/4401) and [#4609](https://github.com/google-gemini/gemini-cli/pull/4609) on the Gemini CLI repo.
- MCP server management
- Token/cost information
- More advanced tool call support

## How it works

Gemini CLI can function as an ACP (Agent Communication Protocol) server, which enables real-time communication via JSON-RPC 2.0 between the client, Gemini Desktop, and the server, Gemini CLI.

## Building from source

### Prerequisites

Gemini Desktop is written using Rust and Tauri for the backend and web technologies for the frontend.  You'll need to install the following when building it from source:

- [Rust](https://rust-lang.org)
- [Node.js](https://nodejs.org)
- [pnpm](https://pnpm.io)
- [just](https://just.systems)

#### Installing Just

If you're on macOS/Linux and you use [asdf](https://asdf-vm.com), you can install `just` with the following commands:

```bash
asdf plugin add just
asdf install just latest
```

If you're on Windows, you can use Winget:

```powershell
winget install --id Casey.Just
```

#### Linux Dependencies

On Linux building Tauri apps requires several dependencies.  If you're using Ubuntu, you can install them all using this command:

```bash
sudo apt install libgdk-pixbuf-2.0-dev \
   libpango1.0-dev \
   libjavascriptcoregtk-4.1-dev \
   libatk1.0-dev \
   libsoup-3.0-dev \
   libwebkit2gtk-4.1-dev
```

### Build

Then clone the repository and run `just deps dev` to start the app:

```bash
git clone https://github.com/Piebald-AI/gemini-desktop
cd gemini-desktop
just deps dev
```

If you want to start the webapp instead, use `just deps dev-web` and go to http://localhost:1420 in your browser.
